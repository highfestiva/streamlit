# AutoMap

A tool for plotting pretty much anything with geo-coordinates in it.

First install Python3 and Streamlit (https://docs.streamlit.io/). Start script by running

```bash
streamlit run automap.py
```

A web page opens. Paste your payload or even plain JSON is fine too. Click the 'Parse' button.
If geo-coordinates were found a bunch of buttons will show up. Click any button to see the
contents plotted to a map.
